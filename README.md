# victron.mppt
Nodemcu v1.0 (esp12e) for Victron MPPT

This code was created based on (http://www.svpartyoffive.com/2018/02/28/victron-monitors-technical/) and (https://github.com/physee/Victron.Arduino-ESP8266).

The first link has details for cable construction (tanks travis) and the second was my inspiration.

This code able to read all data from mppt and published via mqtt.

I hope that be usefull.
